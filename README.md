<h1>Admin Dashboard</h1>

<h2>A camera website using SASS.</h2>

<p>This project is created using HTML and SASS. I created this following the tutorial of Dev Ed. This was the first that I used SASS. I've changed the images, color, and values of measure. This project was the first time that I used SASS and it's definitely a CSS framework that I would like to get better at to learn to use for future projects. </p>
